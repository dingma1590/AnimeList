# Anime List Project

## What it is:

In this project, I will create an application similar to a todo-list, but is catered towards keeping track of
anime titles. This app will contain several lists (*subject to change*):
- a "finished" list
- a "watching" list
- and a "plan to watch" list

Users will be able to add and remove entries from the lists, sort the lists, and modify the entries in the lists. Certain 
modifications on the lists will be automatic (such as moving an entry from the *watching* list to the *finished* list 
when the user finishes watching an anime).

Anybody who is interested in anime and want an app to keep track of anime titles can utilize this app. This project is
of interest to me because I frequently watch anime, and want to design a tracking app that have functionalities that
are missing in the current tools available. 

## User Stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to add an entry to each list.
- As a user, I want to be able to remove an entry from each list.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a list of entries for each list.
- As a user, I want to be able to see the information of a particular given entry.
